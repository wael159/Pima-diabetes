# Pima-diabetes prediction

## **Project motivation**

In these project we want to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.

## **The Dataset**
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) 

### **Data Description**
The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome (1 - diabetes, 0 = no diabetes)

## **Analaysis Plan**

Here we want to predict whether ot not the patient has diabetes. the target will be 1 or 0 , so it is a supervised binary classification problem. the follwing steps will be followed:


1.   Cleaninng Data
2.   Explarotaory data analysis to discover an intitial insights.
3.   Select the suitable algorithm (KNN, logestic regression, Tree classification,svm)
4.   Fit the data to the model, fine tune, evaluate and validate.


**Note :** 


1- The data also is old from 1998, so we dont really know how much it is accurate. <br>
2- the data is just from female participants so in the machine learning we will just predict the dibetes for the females . 
the data also is so small ,we dont have a lot of records to predict and make a generalization.<br>
3- In the data there is no id for each participant so we could not know if there is a duplicate or if there is some participnats who make the test two times.
